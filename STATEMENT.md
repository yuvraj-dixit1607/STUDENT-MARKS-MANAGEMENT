 Problem Statement

Managing student marks manually can get messy and time-consuming, especially when the class size grows. It becomes difficult to quickly update marks, search for a particular student, or calculate overall performance. To make this process simpler, this project provides a small Python program that helps store and manage basic student mark details in an organized way.

# Scope of the Project

This project is a console-based Python application that focuses on basic marks management for three subjects. The user can add, update, delete, search, and view student records. The program also calculates the total marks, percentage, and grade automatically. All data is stored temporarily in memory while the program runs, making the project simple and easy to understand.

# Target Users

- Teachers or class representatives who want a simple way to manage marks.
- Students who are learning Python and want to practice lists, loops, and modular programming.
- Anyone looking for a lightweight marks-handling tool without needing a database.

# High-Level Features

- Add, update, and delete student records  
- Automatic calculation of total marks, percentage, and grade  
- View all students in a structured format  
- Search for a student using their roll number  
- Class statistics including:
  - Total number of students  
  - Average percentage  
  - Highest-scoring student (topper)
